            Orbital horizon is a personal project I am creating with a friend. Its about a person who is sent into space to farm and survive
            as long as they can whilst being forced to make decisions to choose which space politics to join. The project started in the start
            of summer 2024, and is still in development. We plan on this project to be a fully fully released this game on steam in the future.
            I am the lead programmer, who also does a lot of game designing and direction of the game. I am also doing pixel art and music.

            A project based on a platformer game created in a framework called GEF. I contributed 99% of the architecture for the game
            and the presentation. This was a school project to demonstrate game architecure by building on top of an existing framework.
