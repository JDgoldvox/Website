            Orbital horizon is a personal project I am creating with a friend. Its about a person who is sent into space to farm and survive
            as long as they can whilst being forced to make decisions to choose which space politics to join. The project started in the start
            of summer 2024, and is still in development. We plan on this project to be a fully fully released this game on steam in the future.
            I am the lead programmer, who also does a lot of game designing and direction of the game. I am also doing pixel art and music.

            This is a game about a YOU, being a black smith. You can forge swords by getting material and putting it into the forge, to hammering it on the anvil
            whilst making sure the request is correct from each customer. I was the only coder for this game with a team of 6.

            A physics simulation project created using our own physics engine focused on explosions. My contribution to this project was making
            sure that the code reflected real life equations and worked on 50% of the code base with another programmer. I worked with a classmate
            to produce this prototype.

            This is a project created in unity with the intended prupose of creating minecraft-like generated caves within a 3D space.
            This was a a fun 2 person project I did with a classmate. We both did a lot of research as we had no idea how to accomplish this. We both did
            a lot coding and long pair coding hours. We learned a lot in this! In our project, we created procedural world generation using 3D Perlin noise.
            We also created chunking with the help of spatial quantisation.

            A project based on a platformer game created in a framework called GEF. I contributed 99% of the architecture for the game
