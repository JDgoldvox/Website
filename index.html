        <p class = "introductionText"> Welcome to VOX STUDIOS! Hi, My name is Wang Grundy, also known as JDgoldvox.
            I am a Game developer. I love making games and messing around with unity.
            I am currently in University studying Computer Game Technology and hope
            to graduate in 2025. I am currently working on a bunch of solo projects
            like Advent of code, random unity projects as well as trying to create
            more for my portfolio. Sorry for the website being so empty currently,
            I am still learning to code in HTML and hope to make this website as wonderful
            and as exicing as I imagine it to be. Thanks for reading.
        </p>

                    I am a big fan of learning new languages and cultures. I think being able to immerse yourself in a new place is so fun. 
                    Exploring different cultures gives you experience in so much more than just your regular surroundings. However, a big issue 
                    I always have is that I start a language without ever finishing it! To name a few, I’ve started Chinese, French, Spanish, Swedish,
                    and Portuguese…there are a lot more I haven’t mentioned.
                <br><br>
                
                    I enjoy creating music (even though I am not too great) and being able to put my creative efforts into something I can appreciate
                    and share with the world. I love creating experiences for other people. I play the guitar I’m trying to learn the piano. 
                <br><br>
                    Another hobby of mine is hiking! I’m still new to this sport, but walking up mountains with my dog is a wonderful experience. 
                    Finding breathtaking scenery that I can’t even capture with a camera to do justice is something out of this world.
                <br><br>
                    Within my programming, I love exploring algorithms, particularly with AI such as A*, it's incredible what you can do with simple pathfinding. 
                    I am also into optimising my data usage using oct trees and space quantisation. I hope to continue some of these advanced techniques within my games.

                I am a large advocate for people’s rights, this includes gender inclusivity, environmental habits, discrimination and war.
                I wish to be in a world where everybody is accepted, giving everybody free will and choice to what they do with their bodies. 
                If everybody played games and learned the differences in traditions and communicated with each other, then the world would be a much happier place.
                I want to accomplish this by sticking to my morals and creating peace on Earth.

                    My goal is to create games that create proper, diverse and world-changing connections in millions of people’s lives.
                    I would like everybody to learn something new, or to at least get in touch with another person who isn’t like them. 
                    I would like to build a tool for kids and adults alike to form bonds overseas and on continents.
