            <p> Welcome to VOX STUDIOS! My name is Wang Grundy, also known as JDgoldvox.
                I am a Game developer. I love making games and messing around with unity.
                I am currently in University studying Computer Game Technology and hope
                to graduate in 2025. I am currently working on a bunch of solo projects
                like Advent of code, random unity projects as well as trying to create
                more for my portfolio. Sorry for the website being so empty currently,
                I am still learning to code in HTML and hope to make this website as wonderful
                and as exicing as I image it to be. Thanks for reading.
            </p>
